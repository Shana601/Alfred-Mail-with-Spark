# Alfred-Mail-with-Spark
Description: This is just an Alfred workflow simple file action as "Spark to".

Instruction: Enable your buffer in Alfred 3 first. Search the files you want to mail, if more than one, add them to buffer with shortcuts `⌥ + ↑` or `⌥ + ↓`,
then use the buffer action shortcuts `⌥ + →` to open the file action,
select spark to, and spark opens with all the selected files as your attachments.

Note: I'm new to Alfred, I never tried Alfred 2, not sure if it'll work in Alfred 2.
And this is just a quick file action workflow, not fully tested.
